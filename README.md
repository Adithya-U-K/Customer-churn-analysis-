# Customer-churn-analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
The goal is to understand which factors contribute to customer attrition and to build data-driven insights that can help businesses improve customer retention.

## Tools & Libraries

Python 3
pandas – for data loading and manipulation
numpy – for numerical operations
matplotlib – for data visualization
seaborn – for advanced plots

## Key Steps in the Analysis

Data Loading & Cleaning
-Handle missing values and inconsistent data
-Convert categorical variables if required
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Visualize churn distribution
-Explore relationships between churn and other variables
-Identify important churn factors
Feature Engineering 
-Encoding categorical variables
-Scaling numerical features

## Example Insights

Customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn
High monthly charges correlate with increased churn probability
Contract type and payment method strongly influence customer retention
